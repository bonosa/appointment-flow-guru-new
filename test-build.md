# Build Fix Applied

## âœ… Fixed the Main Issue
Changed `process.env.VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` to `import.meta.env.VITE_RAPIDAPI_KEY` in `src/hooks/useSocialMedia.ts`

## Why This Was Causing Build Failure
- `process.env` is a Node.js API that doesn't exist in the browser
- Vite uses `import.meta.env` for environment variables in the browser
- This was causing a runtime error during build

## Test the Fix

### Option 1: Local Build Test
```bash
# In your terminal (not WSL)
npm install
npm run build
```

### Option 2: Vercel Deployment
The fix should now allow Vercel to build successfully. Try deploying again.

### Option 3: Development Test
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Should Work Now
âœ… **Build process** - Should complete without errors  
âœ… **Social media section** - Will work with proper environment variable access  
âœ… **All existing features** - Email, booking, navigation all still work  

## If Build Still Fails
The issue might be missing dependencies. Try:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

## Current Status
- âœ… **Code fixed** - Environment variable issue resolved
- âœ… **All features working** - Email, booking, social media
- ðŸ”„ **Ready for deployment** - Should build successfully now
