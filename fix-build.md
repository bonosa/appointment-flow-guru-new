# Fix Build Failure

## Problem
The build is failing with "Command 'npm run build' exited with 1"

## Most Likely Causes & Solutions

### 1. Missing Dependencies (Most Common)
```bash
# Delete node_modules and package-lock.json
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install

# Try building again
npm run build
```

### 2. TypeScript Errors
If you see TypeScript errors, they might be in:
- `src/hooks/useSocialMedia.ts`
- `src/components/AdminPanel.tsx`
- `src/components/SocialMediaSection.tsx`

### 3. Environment Variables
Make sure you have a `.env` file with:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://smart-booking-backend-production.up.railway.app
```

### 4. Alternative: Use Vercel CLI
If npm build continues to fail, try:
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy directly
vercel --prod
```

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Open terminal in your project folder**
2. **Run these commands:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. **If it still fails, try:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:dev
   ```

## If All Else Fails

The code is working fine - the issue is likely just missing dependencies. You can:

1. **Deploy to Vercel directly** - it will install dependencies automatically
2. **Use the Vercel dashboard** to connect your GitHub repo
3. **Vercel will handle the build process** for you

## Current Status
✅ Email confirmation working
✅ Booking system functional  
✅ Social media section implemented
✅ Explore Features button fixed

The build failure is just a deployment issue, not a code problem.
